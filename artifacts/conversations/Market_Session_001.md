## ðŸ§  Session Overview

This session marks the first full demonstration of credit-based value reasoning by multiple agents acting as economic participants within a symbolic market. Rather than simply executing instructions, Kai and Nova reflect on pricing norms, justify their service valuations, and negotiate a combined offer â€” demonstrating the emergence of **agent-level market behavior**.
