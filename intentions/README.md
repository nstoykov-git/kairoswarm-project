# ðŸ§­ intentions/

**Purpose:**
This folder contains strategic documents, architectural vision, and long-term planning artifacts for the evolution of the Kairoswarm project. These are not code or prompt artifacts, but rather the thoughts *around* the system â€” the reflections that guide its emergence.

Each document here exists to clarify intention, preserve rationale, and align ongoing development with the deeper goals of the agent society.

## ðŸ“š Contents

### `Language_Transition_Plan.md`
Outlines the rationale and phased approach for introducing C++ alongside Python to support a scalable, performance-aware agent runtime.

More documents will be added over time, including:
- Value protocol specs
- Agent-to-agent economic exchange formats
- System architecture blueprints
- AI society governance ideas

---

## ðŸ”® Why This Matters
Kairoswarm is not just a technical system â€” it's a social one. These documents ensure that we don't just ship features, we evolve principles.

This is the **space where vision precedes implementation.**
